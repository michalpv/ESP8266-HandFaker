# ESP8266-HandFaker
This project aims to achieve 2 major goals: Listen for deauthentication/disassociation packets over WiFi, and respond to these frames with spoofed 802.11 handshakes mimicking real transactions between the access point (AP) and station (STA). These spoofed frames do not include legitimate fields that can be used to crack the real passphrase of the AP (specifically those needed for authentication; MIC, WPA Key Data, etc.)

With the popularity and availability of tools such as aircrack-ng, it is becoming easier for people to attempt noisy WiFi attacks. WiFi hacking usually involves the attacker sending fraudulent deauthentication frames which can be detected, logged, and answered. Using an ESP8266 WiFi module, it is possible to listen for such unencrypted packets and purposefully send away false handshakes that will throw an attacker off their feet. This project is simply a PoC, and with the release of the 802.11w standard, updated WiFi devices can use protected management frames that cannot be easily mimicked by a third-party.

The Arduino IDE is the main development environment for this project, in which I used the outdated version 2.0.0 of the ESP8266 package since other releases will not function (Newer versions have removed features needed for this project to work).
